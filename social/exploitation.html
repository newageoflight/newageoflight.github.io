To actually want to do anything, you need to think the right way.
Watch and read self-improvement material.
</p>

<p>
Also probably need some general motivational stuff. Yeah read a help
book or two if you want.
</p>

<p>
Treat relationships like plants. Give them the right attention and
care and they will thrive; deprive them thereof and they will die.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The truth is most people, even the trained ones, are no better than chance at spotting fibs</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a bit of an odd assumption here (maybe backed up by his experience) which is that people will not <i>fake</i> the signs of confidence when lying.</li>
<li>People might be more uncomfortable when lying
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Liars will rarely engage in physical contact or touch with people OR objects.</li>
<li>When people hear something they don&rsquo;t like they&rsquo;ll often close their eyes to &ldquo;block it out&rdquo;.</li>
<li>They might flush or lighten in colour out of discomfort</li>
<li>They might have white knuckles from grabbing the chair armrest in a fixed manner like an &ldquo;ejector seat&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Synchrony is the other key. Do their verbal and nonverbal cues agree?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One answering in the affirmative should have a positive head movement that immediately supports what is said. Not delayed.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So if they say &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it&rdquo; while nodding, they&rsquo;re probably full of shit</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Emphasis is universal to being genuine
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Liars will not place appropriate emphasis</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Liars tend to display less steepling</li>
<li>Palms up = desperation, I want you to believe me.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Not a confident, dominant display. Basically like a white flag.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-2-1-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Aims
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Communicate very strongly that it&rsquo;s now your partner&rsquo;s turn to talk</li>
<li>Give a strong suggestion for the topic of conversation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Method
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use open-ended questions (shows interest - you <i>want</i> to get to
know them better)</li>
<li>Start superficial, slowly go more intimate. But monitor their
comfort level. Back off if they become uncomfortable, but keep
digging if they are consistently comfortable.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note that this isn&rsquo;t over one convo, it&rsquo;s over a whole
relationship.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>First time you meet sb: nice weather innit? (very
superficial) -&gt; how&rsquo;s work? (slightly more
intimate). Inappropriate topics would be like their divorce.</li>
<li>As time goes by and you have more convos with them, each
convo is an opportunity to dig a little deeper. You may
eventually reach peak/plateau intimacy but that only happens
after many convos</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t overuse - that would be an interview and not a convo</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use when
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You&rsquo;re not sure what to say next</li>

<ul class="org-ul">

another.</li>

something too

the other person to guide you on this</li>

going to be interested in, you don&rsquo;t have to match perfectly
to the other person. Just think about what they&rsquo;d be
interested in</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thoughts
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sharing your thoughts encourages partner to share their own.</li>
<li>Warning: don&rsquo;t do this if you sound like a lecturer when doing
this, or tend to belittle people who disagree with you. You
will make your partner uncomfortable.</li>
<li>Do it in such a way to welcome discussion and different opinions.</li>
<li>Ask for honest feedback from trusted friends or family members
on how well you welcome others&rsquo; thoughts and opinions. You may
feel very open, but it could be that you&rsquo;re doing something
that makes others uncomfortable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Story
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As in their important experiences e.g. marriage, graduation, a
road trip with their friends</li>
<li>Sharing your own story will usually work to make them respond
with something similar</li>

passion or fear and how that has shaped you</li>
<li>And don&rsquo;t forget the rules of intimacy</li>

<li>Usage

<p>
All in all the purpose of &ldquo;small talk&rdquo; is to get to know someone, <i>you do that by getting them to talk about themselves</i>. At least for me, framing it as an &ldquo;orientation test&rdquo; helps to dispel some of the anxiety (because the other person is likely to be quite anxious about it too&#x2026;)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-1">
<p>
I&rsquo;ve generally found it much easier to deal with smaller groups or 1-on-1 conversations than larger groups. The agony of choice, basically. From my observations (I feel like a fucking idiot for not having noticed these kinds of things before), here are some principles for dealing with encountering people in public:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You&rsquo;re supposed to just say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; to someone you know if they pass you in the corridors. This includes while talking to someone else
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If it&rsquo;s a senior or a superior, do the same. IMO &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; feels weird, this isn&rsquo;t high school. Just use their title and/or name.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This book was written in America. In America, &ldquo;sir&rdquo; is used much more commonly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re between cliques, don&rsquo;t ignore your other clique while talking to them. Don&rsquo;t act like you&rsquo;re trying to separate your social relationships into clusters. JUST SAY A GREETING IF ANYONE YOU KNOW GETS CLOSE ENOUGH (or smile and nod at least lol)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Greetings are much better than ignoring people or going out of your way to dodge people. Get caught and it will certainly backfire.</li>
<li>To avoid being put into situations where you feel extremely awkward (like wanting to be alone on public transport so you can do Anki), consider arriving earlier or later than other people. The polite thing to do when seeing someone you know and are on speaking terms with is always to engage with them rather than to avoid them. Congratulations, you now understand why popular people don&rsquo;t always like being popular.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some people purposefully put on headphones and stuff to give the whole &ldquo;go away I&rsquo;m busy&rdquo; impression. Overdo this and it will almost certainly backfire.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<li>Be open to everyone</li>
<li>Be yourself</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Overall they are similar in purpose - the primary purpose is to talk
to people and meet them. However the obvious difference is the
formality level and the topic set which befits the occasion
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If it&rsquo;s very loud e.g. a nightclub or dance party, you basically
need to shout or learn to speak louder without appearing to shout
(very valuable skill for handling geris patients lol)</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Relax, we&rsquo;re all nerds here</li>
<li>An algorithm for approaching people. The key to doing this is
suppressing that feeling of dread
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Approach someone who&rsquo;s not talking to someone and doesn&rsquo;t look busy</li>
<li>Say &ldquo;Hi I&rsquo;m {{name}}&rdquo;</li>
<li>Make appropriate small talk</li>
<li>Part ways at a suitable juncture. If you enjoyed each other&rsquo;s
company you can greet each other again later on</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This is the expected i.e. acceptable and highly welcomed
behaviour - because the very point of such events is to network
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It can be a bit awkward and imperfect - but at least it works!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to choose who you pick on
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People you recognise from before</li>
<li>People you&rsquo;ve met in passing but haven&rsquo;t properly talked to yet</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s a conference, the speaker is a good target especially if
you have questions</li>
<li>Pick on other minorities who might be isolated</li>
<li>Pick someone random</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to make small talk at conferences
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The talks and aspects of them</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Parting ways
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don&rsquo;t latch onto just the one person</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a natural rhythm to conferences so just get on with that</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other tips
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try chaining people you&rsquo;ve met together (if you meet someone and
someone you know walks past, shout out to them and ask them if
they&rsquo;ve met) - gauge if this is appropriate ofc</li>
<li>If someone&rsquo;s awkwardly standing around, try bringing them into
your fold (&ldquo;Hi I&rsquo;m {{name}}, wanna join us?&rdquo; is usually
sufficient)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/social-briefing-5-event-dont-know-anyone/">https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/social-briefing-5-event-dont-know-anyone/</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As always, people can smell confidence from a mile away. Wear it
proudly.</li>
<li>Pick on some other outsiders</li>
<li>&ldquo;Open&rdquo; groups vs &ldquo;closed&rdquo; ones - you can usually tell by how they
are facing each other and the lack of physical space between people
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Open ones are gathered more loosely, talk is lighter and
participants may already be looking around for other convos</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It may be harder to intrude on smaller groups because it&rsquo;s far
more conspicuous and likely to be awkward/unwanted. Larger groups
on the other hand, may be easier to sidle up on and someone might
let you in. If you decide that you don&rsquo;t like them it&rsquo;s also
easier to slip out.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While you might perceive the social risk on you as being greater, the &ldquo;cost&rdquo; of admitting a stranger to the group is generally absorbed better by larger groups (in the same way that whales can absorb larger monetary loss)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ok, so how do you enter?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Compliments
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To the whole group: &ldquo;y&rsquo;all seem to be having the best time
here&rdquo;</li>
<li>NOT to an individual among them</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ask a question
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;Do y&rsquo;all know who brought the stuffed mushrooms?&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drop in as a passerby
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don&rsquo;t say something creepy like &ldquo;Were y&rsquo;all talking about X?
Mind if I, um, add something here?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Act like you just heard someone say something and you have
something to add</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take the honest approach and say &ldquo;Hope you don&rsquo;t mind me
approaching you randomly like this but I don&rsquo;t know anyone here,
I&rsquo;m X&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Have a clear purpose/agenda in mind for it</li>
<li>Wait for a lull in the convo</li>
<li>Bring the conversation around to why you connected at first
e.g. if you asked someone for a class recommendation &ldquo;I appreciate
the tip. I&rsquo;ll definitely try to get into that class during
enrollment&rdquo;</li>
<li>Use an exit line (something that fits with the agenda)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Generic examples
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I need to get a seat/use the bathroom before the movie starts</li>
<li>I have a question I wanted to ask the speaker before he leaves</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve got to get back to work - there&rsquo;s a deadline I got to meet.</li>
<li>and so forth</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you did the initiating, the exit line changes a bit. Try to
suggest you have crossed something off your checklist (yes, use
the word &ldquo;just&rdquo;)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So, just wanted to make sure everything was okay</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If someone else asked you for help/advice, conclude with
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is there anything else you needed?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the above are not appropriate (past tense = closure)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Well, it was great catching up with you/seeing you again</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All purpose exit lines for when they look like they want out or
you can&rsquo;t think of anything else because they sound like an
attempt to run away
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don&rsquo;t want to monopolize all your time</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t want to keep you from your work</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Exit non-lines
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Introducing them to sb else and then say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you guys talk&rdquo;</li>
<li>Get them to introduce you to sb else (if they know someone they
will usually do sth)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do you know anyone who&rsquo;s dealt with the guys who run X?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m really interested in X - do you know anyone with
experience in it?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been wondering about how to get started with X - do you
know anyone who&rsquo;s done that?</li>
<li>Can you suggest anyone who could help with X?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Invite them to do sth with you (the idea is that they&rsquo;ll refuse,
or if they accept, you can hook up with some more people who can
liven things up)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I&rsquo;m going to try meet the speaker. Do you want to come?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m ready for another drink. Wanna head over to the bar with
me?</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bow out when others join (this is standard - when other people
join and things get going between them, slip out)</li>
<li>End with appreciation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>End interactions with appreciation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thank yo for sharing your thoughts on going to law
school, X. It really helped me think it through.</li>
<li>It was good catching up with you, X. (other generic

<li>To make people like you, you have to be a good person. But to give off the impression of being one, you can&rsquo;t openly express how much you dislike certain people.</li>

<li>Of course, part of having a likeable personality is being able to respect others. So that is also included here.</li>
<li>Do not think that <i>honne</i> and <i>tatemae</i> are strictly Japanese concepts, they are expressed in every culture to different extents, the difference largely lies in how the difference is resolved.

Tread carefully! Most people in business (or even who work in general) have probably heard of this book and are aware of techniques like &ldquo;compliment sandwiches&rdquo; when giving criticism.
</p>

<p>
The impression I get is that people like people who seem genuine and overuse of these techniques can seem inauthentic. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean this advice is not useful, it is definitely universally applicable.
</p>

<p>
Go and read the book because it has a lot more examples/explanation. There&rsquo;s even an updated version for the digital age. Anyway here&rsquo;s the summary.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-1-1-1-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The best argument is one not fought (i.e. avoid arguments like the plague)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most of the time all this does is make sb feel embarrassed/uncomfortable/inferior/pride-wounded</li>
<li>Misunderstanding is never ended by argument, but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the others&rsquo; viewpoint</li>
<li>If sb tries to argue w/ you and brings up a pt you haven&rsquo;t thought of, show them appreciation of that point and talk on that</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t trust your first instinct when you feel an argument coming. Sometimes we react harshly when we feel the need to defend ourselves, and this brings out the worst.</li>
<li>ctrl yo temper</li>
<li>Listen first. Let them talk, try to find understandings.</li>
<li>Look for areas of agreement</li>
<li>Apologise for mistakes or errors you&rsquo;ve made while arguing. Pride aside.</li>
<li>Promise to think over your opponents&rsquo; ideas and study them carefully, and mean it. After all they could be right.</li>
<li>Thank your opponents for their interest in what you were discussing and them wanting to improve on what you believe.</li>
<li>Perhaps postpone debate/argument so you can both get your head and facts clear. More time to think on points and if the argument is worth their pride. What might you lose if you win?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Show respect for others&rsquo; opinions. Never say &ldquo;you&rsquo;re wrong&rdquo;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Telling sb they&rsquo;re wrong is a direct blow at their intelligence, pride and self-respect. It incites retaliation rather than agreement</li>
<li>If you are going to prove anything, try not to let anyone know about it. Do it subtly/adroitly, out of any view/sight.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Men must be taught as if you taught them not, And things unknown as things forgot&rdquo; - Alexander Pope</li>
<li>If sb says sth you <b>know</b> to be wrong, say sth like this
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;Well, look, I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I&rsquo;m wrong, I want to be put right. So let&rsquo;s examine the facts&rdquo;</li>
<li>i.e. acknowledging you may be wrong, saying &ldquo;this is all i know atm&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Respect other&rsquo;s opinions and treat them courteously</li>
<li>You will avoid trouble by admitting you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and inspire your opponent ot be just as fair and open-minded as you to the fact that he himself could be too.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t tell anyone they&rsquo;re wrong. Use diplomacy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be humble by saying derogatory things about yourself you know the other person wants/intends to say - chances are they will then have a forgiving attitude towards you and minimise your mistakes in their minds</li>
<li>There is a certain degree of satisfaction to be found in admitting one&rsquo;s errors. Takes guilt and persuasiveness out of the air, but also helps solve the problem created by the error</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Begin in a friendly way
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You might feel good after an episode of outrage, but they certainly won&rsquo;t, nor will they agree with you or be inclined to since you damaged their pride</li>
<li>Convince them you are their friend to get them to do your bidding</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get the other person saying &ldquo;yes, yes&rdquo; immediately
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don&rsquo;t start by talking about differences. Speak on commonalities.</li>
<li>Get them to keep agreeing as once they start disagreeing it&rsquo;ll be hard to bring them back</li>
<li>Keep emphasising that you both have a common end-goal in mind, but your differences lie in method</li>
<li>By asking questions they&rsquo;re forced to agree on and continually eliciting &ldquo;yeses&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll want to conclude with your side being right and not their own</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let the other person do a great deal of the talking (safety valve for handling complaints)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most people trying to convince others talk too much</li>
<li>Let the other person talk themselves out, as they know more about their issues than you</li>
<li>If you disagree, don&rsquo;t interrupt, but let them finish</li>
<li>Encourage them to express everything out</li>
<li>Almost every successful person likes to reminisce about his early struggles (remember this for interviews/rapport!)</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you want to make enemies, excel your friends. If you want friends, let your friends excel you&rdquo; i.e. build you friends up, listen to their accomplishments, don&rsquo;t boast about your own (only talk WHEN ASKED)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let the other person feel the idea is theirs
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most people prefer to feel they are acting on their own ideas or accord, not told/sold something</li>
<li>So ask for their ideas/advice on something</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try to honestly see things from the other person&rsquo;s POV
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don&rsquo;t condemn them for being wrong even if they are DEAD WRONG AF. Instead try to understand why they would say sth like that</li>
<li>Try to put yourself in that person&rsquo;s shoes and try to figure out why they act/talk thus</li>
<li>Try to think through their POV, why sb should want to adapt to your POV, and also how they would like to hear what you are saying</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be sympathetic with others&rsquo; ideas/desires
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How to elicit good will and dispel ill will while attracting listening:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Notice that this phrase is a simple truism (if you were them, you would not be you)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No-one typically deserves a lot of credit for being who they are. Their environment/experiences help det that</li>
<li>3/4 of people you meet want sympathy. Give it to them and they will love you.</li>
<li>Before you speak back to sb who has offended you or is debating you, remember and try to react differently from just anybody. Respond like a wise man and not an idiot.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Appeal to nobler motives
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Everybody usually has 2 reasons for doing sth: one that sounds good, and the real reason</li>
<li>They may know the real reason, but you don&rsquo;t need to emphasise it. Instead appeal to sth that sounds good. Show them good motives behind agreeing to what you&rsquo;re trying to convince them of.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dramatise your ideas
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People remember and pay attention to things that are more dramatic (see cognitive biases)</li>
<li>This isn&rsquo;t lying. Say something that dramatises the importance of your point.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If nothing else works, throw down a challenge
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Stimulate competition, not in sordid money-grabs, but the desire to excel</li>
<li>People love the chance to express themselves, their worth, and to show their importance</li>
<li>Examples of things to say
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realise you were a coward/quitter/etc.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t take that class. After all, only smart people can pass it.&rdquo;</li>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-4-1-1-1-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you must find fault, begin with praise and honest appreciation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is always more comfortable to hear something unpleasant about ourselves <i>after</i> we have heard praise about one of our good points
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Analogy: giving anaesthetic before surgery/dental drilling</li>
<li>A barber always lathers a man before he shaves him</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>To criticise people without consequence, call attention to their mistakes indirectly
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise, but them follow with &ldquo;but&rdquo; and then a critical statment
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking swole, but your legs make it look like you don&rsquo;t even lift&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once sb hears &ldquo;but&rdquo;, it makes them question the sincerity of the praise and that it was only there to cushion an insult</li>
<li>Using &ldquo;and&rdquo; instead might alleviate this effect, or change the wording such that it becomes &ldquo;you still can do better&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;you actually suck&rdquo;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking thick/solid/tight, and if you work on your legs more people will defs think you&rsquo;re shredded&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Praise now appears sincere, may make them want to live up to our expectations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Talk about your own mistakes before criticising others
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When someone&rsquo;s giving you shit, it feels a lot more sympathetic if they say &ldquo;I am also shit&rdquo; first</li>
<li>Admitting your own mistakes, even when they&rsquo;ve been corrected, can help convince sb to change</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ask questions (suggest), don&rsquo;t command
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Suggestion saves pride and self-importance, and encourages cooperation instead of rebellion</li>
<li>Makes commands seem more palatable and often stimulates their creativity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let the other person save face
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don&rsquo;t belittle anyone</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Praise every improvement, no matter how slight. Be &ldquo;hearty in approbation and lavish in praise&rdquo;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Words of praise can change lives.</li>
<li>Caruso was told by his teacher he couldn&rsquo;t sing. But he kept going because his mother praised him.</li>
<li>Give specific praise instead of short flattery.</li>
<li>Abilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Change their attitude by giving them a big rep to live up to

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Understand your own emotions first. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to express them
and talk about them
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Allow yourself to feel them. We are all humans here.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t know why you feel this way? Think about it! (or write about
it like I do)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once you are capable of doing that, try to genuinely understand it
from the other person&rsquo;s perspective
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why does <i>everyone</i> say that this is something I need to work on?</li>
<li>Often something that seems stupid to you may seem quite
interesting to the other person - think from the other person&rsquo;s
perspective (my main problem with this is that you don&rsquo;t know
enough about their background to reasonably simulate their way of
thinking. in that case the best approach is to just listen and try
to form one)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nonverbal cues also go a long way
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This comes down to the principle of mirroring. You want to reflect
someone&rsquo;s (or a situation&rsquo;s) energy levels right back at them</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-4-1-1-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Raw, unadulterated kindness may be viewed with suspicion or as being &ldquo;too much&rdquo;, so don&rsquo;t necessarily follow the book to the letter</li>
<li>If someone says something self-deprecating don&rsquo;t necessarily try to say something nice in return, especially if the intent is obviously humorous</li>
<li>The general principles are the same but it should seem natural like you&rsquo;re conversant with a peer</li>
<li>Not everyone enjoys being complimented or praised, so frame it as &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to embarrass you&rdquo; or &ldquo;I know you might not want me to say this&rdquo; if this seems to be the case (gauge first by just throwing one out there)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People I know don&rsquo;t seem to hesitate with compliments, regardless of whom they&rsquo;re giving it to (god knows how many times I&rsquo;ve been complimented on my (mum&rsquo;s) fashion sense). Evidently this is not something to be afraid of.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t get hyperbolically high-energy with people you aren&rsquo;t somewhat familiar with, you aren&rsquo;t in high school anymore; something like &ldquo;I like your coat&rdquo; is fine for anyone really.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-4-1-1-5">

<li>Most of these behaviours can be traced back to the idea that Westerners value FREEDOM and INDIVIDUALISM. There is not much of a sense of communitarianism or conformity compared to Asian cultures
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The downside of this is that narcissists and sociopaths tend to get ahead in life because their being full of themselves (or just downright manipulative) translates to apparent self-confidence</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No, seriously, Westerners &ldquo;default&rdquo; reaction is not &ldquo;not much of a talker, eh? fair enough&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;oh my god have I offended them did I say/do something wrong please help&rdquo;.

<ul class="org-ul">

Much as I might like to deny it I&rsquo;m coming around to the idea that I may be a closeted narcissist (you remember in a psych class in 2nd year they showed a slide on NPD and the girls quipped that it sounded just like <i>you</i>?). After all, for the longest time I predicated my sense of self upon being a cut above everyone else (and by extension, the idea that other people are somehow worse than I in some aspect). And by the looks of it, the opposite could not be more true. So what&rsquo;s next? Here are some pages that might help (honestly the tips are the same as Dale Carnegie&rsquo;s book - anything you say or do, weigh the impact on them):

My ILP supervisor was basically a closeted narcissist. With all the &ldquo;respecc muh authoriteh&rdquo; bs and &ldquo;i have so many things you can do but i&rsquo;m never going to give them to you&rdquo;. However I can&rsquo;t say for sure that he&rsquo;s a unique case of a bad supervisor/surgeon. There&rsquo;s many surgeons working under UNSW who have NPD traits (looking at YOU, Dr Chambers). And there&rsquo;s lots of anecdotes about dickhead surgeons, and evidence to show that surgeons are commonly perceived as arrogant, egotistical pricks with a head too full of their own egos (that word cloud about them lol). DON&rsquo;T BE LIKE THEM. Even &ldquo;The Good Doctor&rdquo; is a role model compared to some of these guys.

Learn to use these to your advantage, and spot when someone is using them against you. Chances are most people will not spot these outright so you can abuse them at your will on the weak-minded.
Obvious examples include &ldquo;tu quoque&rdquo;, &ldquo;think of the children&rdquo; and &ldquo;straw man&rdquo; style arguments, which people often use to do things like discredit particular people/groups (Clementine Ford is a misandrist -&gt; feminists in general are stupid), or advocate particular policies (porn is bad for kids -&gt; more internet censorship), or even disregard your argument altogether (you&rsquo;re a hypocrite -&gt; what you&rsquo;re saying must be wrong)

<dt>Reactive devaluation</dt><dd>Devaluing proposals only because they purportedly originated with an adversary.</dd>
<dt>Recency illusion</dt><dd>The illusion that a word or language usage is a recent innovation when it is in fact long-established (see also frequency illusion).</dd>

<dt>Subadditivity effect</dt><dd>The tendency to judge probability of the whole to be less than the probabilities of the parts.</dd>
<dt>Subjective validation</dt><dd>Perception that something is true if a subject&rsquo;s belief demands it to be true. Also assigns perceived connections between coincidences.</dd>
<dt>Survivorship bias</dt><dd>Concentrating on the people or things that &ldquo;survived&rdquo; some process and inadvertently overlooking those that didn&rsquo;t because of their lack of visibility.</dd>
<dt>Time-saving bias</dt><dd>Underestimations of the time that could be saved (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) from a relatively low speed and overestimations of the time that could be saved (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) from a relatively high speed.</dd>

<dt>Cross-race effect</dt><dd>The tendency for people of one race to have difficulty identifying members of a race other than their own.</dd>
<dt>Cryptomnesia</dt><dd>A form of misattribution where a memory is mistaken for imagination, because there is no subjective experience of it being a memory.</dd>
<dt>Egocentric bias</dt><dd>Recalling the past in a self-serving manner, e.g., remembering one&rsquo;s exam grades as being better than they were, or remembering a caught fish as bigger than it really was.</dd>

<dt>Humor effect</dt><dd>That humorous items are more easily remembered than non-humorous ones, which might be explained by the distinctiveness of humor, the increased cognitive processing time to understand the humor, or the emotional arousal caused by the humor.</dd>
<dt>Illusion of truth effect</dt><dd>That people are more likely to identify as true statements those they have previously heard (even if they cannot consciously remember having heard them), regardless of the actual validity of the statement.

<dt>Processing difficulty effect</dt><dd>That information that takes longer to read and is thought about more (processed with more difficulty) is more easily remembered.</dd>
<dt>Reminiscence bump</dt><dd>The recalling of more personal events from adolescence and early adulthood than personal events from other lifetime periods</dd>

<dt>Self-serving bias</dt><dd>perceiving oneself responsible for desirable outcomes but not responsible for undesirable ones.</dd>
<dt>Source confusion</dt><dd>Confusing episodic memories with other information, creating distorted memories.</dd>
<dt>Spacing effect</dt><dd>That information is better recalled if exposure to it is repeated over a long span of time rather than a short one.</dd>
<dt>Spotlight effect</dt><dd>The tendency to overestimate the amount that other people notice your appearance or behavior.</dd>
<dt>Stereotypical bias</dt><dd>Memory distorted towards stereotypes (e.g., racial or gender), e.g., &ldquo;black-sounding&rdquo; names being misremembered as names of criminals.</dd>
<dt>(no term)</dt><dd>Subadditivity effect: the tendency to estimate that the likelihood of a remembered event is less than the sum of its (more than two) mutually exclusive components.</dd>
<dt>Suffix effect</dt><dd>Diminishment of the recency effect because a sound item is appended to the list that the subject is not required to recall.</dd>
<dt>Suggestibility</dt><dd>A form of misattribution where ideas suggested by a questioner are mistaken for memory.</dd>
<dt>Telescoping effect</dt><dd>The tendency to displace recent events backward in time and remote events forward in time, so that recent events appear more remote, and remote events, more recent.</dd>
<dt>Testing effect</dt><dd>The fact that you more easily remember information you have read by rewriting it instead of rereading it.</dd>
<dt>Tip of the tongue phenomenon</dt><dd>When a subject is able to recall parts of an item, or related information, but is frustratingly unable to recall the whole item. This is thought to be an instance of &ldquo;blocking&rdquo; where multiple similar memories are being recalled and interfere with each other.</dd>
<dt>Travis Syndrome</dt><dd>Overestimating the significance of the present. It is related to the enlightenment Idea of Progress and chronological snobbery with possibly an appeal to novelty logical fallacy being part of the bias.</dd>
<dt>Verbatim effect</dt><dd>That the &ldquo;gist&rdquo; of what someone has said is better remembered than the verbatim wording. This is because memories are representations, not exact copies.</dd>

The wars of the future will be fought with information, and the battlegrounds will be our minds.
</p>

<p>
When learning about power: part of this is dealing with people, part of this is downright immoral. But it&rsquo;s still useful to understand and be aware of - because many people will try to use these on you! Pollies and people in positions of higher management (or any kind of powerful position tbh) use this shit all the time!
</p>

<p>
So be careful, because some motherfuckers KNOW you&rsquo;re trying to use some Jedi Mind Tricks on them (especially if they&rsquo;re more likely to be skilled at this shit e.g. pollies, higher management, superiors, narcs, psychopaths, etc.)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-3-2">
<p>
While specifically written about tactics for ancient warfare, Sun Tzu&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Art of War&rdquo; can be applied to other aspects of leadership and life too
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The 5 factors of war
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;Dao&rdquo; (moral law) - leadership/loyalty of the people</li>
<li>&ldquo;Tian&rdquo; (sky/heaven) - timing, weather</li>
<li>&ldquo;Di&rdquo; (earth) - distances, danger, terrain, life/death chances</li>
<li>&ldquo;Jiang&rdquo; (commander) - wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage, strictness/rigor, virtue</li>
<li>&ldquo;Fa&rdquo; (method/discipline) - organisation, supply lines and logistics</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All warfare is fundamentally based on deception
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Seem unable to attack when you are; make your forces seem idle when they are on the move; feign being far when close and vice versa</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bait your opponent - feign disorder and crush them
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If secure at all points, be ready</li>
<li>If stronger than you, avoid</li>
<li>If choleric in temperament, irritate them</li>
<li>Feign weakness so they become arrogant</li>
<li>If taking ease, give them no rest</li>
<li>If forces united, separate them</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nobody benefits from prolonged warfare
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It depletes your resources and you are left weak and vulnerable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Win without fighting if possible
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You&rsquo;d rather take all your enemy&rsquo;s resources for yourself than destroy them</li>
<li>Discover and disrupt their plans/intent (through indirection) rather than engaging in direct confrontation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This may change, so learn to adapt</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alternatively, destroy their supplies/logistics. Foraging on the enemy brings them closer to defeat!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t fight a battle you can&rsquo;t win (always get some tactical advantage)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Minimise the amount of information you don&rsquo;t know (always recon!). If you know yourself and the enemy, you will win 10000 battles. If you know Heaven and Earth, you will complete that victory.</li>
<li>Make sure you have a maneuverable army before you go into battle (i.e. you have the moral law by you for your followers). Don&rsquo;t try to maneuver an undisciplined mob
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your army needs to love you (like a father is the example they give) to follow you</li>
<li>Set an example of courage for them all to live up to</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Defeat in detail: put them in situations where they are weakened/divided/stressed so they are easier to defeat (how Napoleon conquered Europe)</li>
<li>Strike at what is weak and avoid what is strong</li>
<li>Be fast; take advantage of any unreadiness or gaping weakness the enemy has. This applies to maneuvering too</li>
<li>If fighting will result in certain victory, then fight, regardless of all else</li>
<li>You can forestall your opponent by seizing what they hold dear</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t get into an alliance with someone until you&rsquo;re familiar with their intentions</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rely on being safe in war; as much as possible, always be better equipped to receive your enemy by being unassailable or better-armed</li>
<li>Once in enemy territory, always keep yourself concealed</li>
<li>5 dangerous faults of a general
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Recklessness - don&rsquo;t be brash and hasty</li>
<li>Cowardice - don&rsquo;t get captured</li>
<li>Temperamentality - don&rsquo;t get triggered into making stupid decisions</li>
<li>Sensitivity to shame - don&rsquo;t get too prideful</li>
<li>Excessive sympathy for one&rsquo;s men - don&rsquo;t get too bogged down in worry and trouble</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Always camp on the high ground facing the sun
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>But don&rsquo;t climb heights to camp</li>
<li>Avoid any difficult terrain e.g. marshes, swampland, mountains, rivers</li>
<li>Avoid the dark - the battlefield and the horizon should always be clear</li>
<li>Be careful of places where enemies could hide in ambush near you, be careful
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Close at hand and is quiet = in a strong position</li>
<li>Aloof and belligerent = anxious for you to attack</li>
<li>Camping in somewhere easy to attack = bait</li>
<li>Could also try to send signals of</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Types of (battle)ground

<li>Dispersive (san) - home territory

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don&rsquo;t halt</li>
<li>Closely connect your forces</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don&rsquo;t attack</li>
<li>Hurry up your rear</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Open (jiao) - provides liberty of movement to both sides
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to block your enemy</li>
<li>Keep an eye on your defenses</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intersecting (qu) - multiple intersecting borders/jurisdictions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Join hands with your allies</li>
<li>Consolidate alliances</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Serious (zhong) - deep into hostile territory
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Gather plunder</li>
<li>Ensure continuous stream of supplies</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Difficult (pi) - difficult-to-traverse
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Keep on marching</li>
<li>Keep pushing forward</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hemmed-in (wei) - access would leave you trapped and vulnerable to attack
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Resort to stratagem</li>
<li>Block retreat</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Desperate (si) - where you can only be saved by fighting at once
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fight</li>
<li>Soldiers need to know that saving their lives is hopeless and they need to fight</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do you discover your enemies&rsquo; intents? SPIES
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Local (yin) - locals of the enemy territory</li>
<li>Inwards (nei) - enemy officials</li>
<li>Converted (fan) - enemy spies who have defected their services to you</li>
<li>Doomed (si) - doing shit just to deceive, and allowing our spies to know of them and reporting them to the enemy</li>
<li>Surviving (sheng) - those who bring back news from the enemy camps</li>

<li>Not from this book but Stephen Covey in &ldquo;7 habits of highly effective people&rdquo; speaks of &ldquo;the emotional bank account&rdquo;. Relationships are like bank accounts that you need to keep making deposits into by offering favours, doing things for them, etc.</li>
<li>Concessions from one side are also viewed as favours in a sense i.e. if one side makes a concession, it&rsquo;ll also trigger the other to be willing to make a concession themselves (usually)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is why techniques like &ldquo;door in the face&rdquo; work for negotiations; because you&rsquo;re making a concession, they feel obligated to reciprocate by making a concession themselves</li>
<li>Arrangements agreed with some perceived concession generate increased feeling of <b>responsibility for</b> and <b>satisfaction with</b> the outcome</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to combat this trick?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you can sense that a &ldquo;favour&rdquo; is really a sales tactic or a dupe, don&rsquo;t bother trying to reciprocate because it&rsquo;s not really a favour</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Commitment and consistency</dt><dd>people like to do the same things as they have done in the past (force of habit)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. if someone puts a small bumper or window sticker saying &ldquo;drive safely&rdquo; they&rsquo;re more likely on the whole to put a huge sign with the same message on their lawn later</li>
<li>cf. sunk cost fallacy</li>
<li>When trying to change someone&rsquo;s perspective, make them believe they came to that idea themselves
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. when teaching children moral lessons, encourage them to reflect on what they did right and wrong. Get them to accept inner responsibility for their actions rather than beating them or punishing them.</li>
<li>I think for adults this&rsquo;d be more like asking them &ldquo;why do you think so? where&rsquo;s that coming from?&rdquo; when they disagree with you and you&rsquo;re trying to sway their opinion. Understand where they are first</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lowballing: in a deal, offer an advantage that induces a favoured behaviour or decision in the subject. Then the subject will justify the decision to themselves by changing their views. Now take away the advantage and the subject will fully support their decision/behaviour with their views</li>
<li>irl examples
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Weight loss clinics force you to write down your goals and share them publicly</li>
<li>Door-to-door salesmen will ask you to fill out the sales agreement, rather than doing it themselves, so you don&rsquo;t feel as much buyer&rsquo;s remorse</li>
<li>College fraternities and hazing: making someone suffer a lot or go through a lot of hurdles/obstacles to get something makes it seem more valuable than something obtained with minimal effort</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fighting back
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If it&rsquo;s obvious, call them out on it and say you&rsquo;re not going to keep doing the same thing just for the sake of consistency</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re not sure what you really believe, ask yourself and pay special attention to your immediate instinct/emotional response. You can lie to yourself and rationalise things when thinking intellectually but not as easily in these basic lizard-brain responses</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Social proof</dt><dd>we copy the actions of others/the many
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If many people are doing something, we naturally assume that to be the good/right thing</li>
<li>This can easily be hijacked e.g. fake reviews on Amazon</li>
<li>cf. bystander effect
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In an emergency, ask for help clearly, directed to one person at a time. Reduce the uncertainties of those people around you re your condition and their responsibilities</li>
<li>This can also be misused e.g. &ldquo;drinking the Kool-Aid&rdquo; (Jonestown mass suicide); surrounded by uncertainty, people will naturally gravitate to following the crowd</li>
</ul></li>
<li>irl
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Canned laughter: hate it all you want but it really works</li>
<li>&ldquo;Salted&rdquo; tip jars: bartenders and other service workers will often put a few bills into the tip jar themselves to give off the impression that others are tipping a lot</li>
<li>Testimonials: we&rsquo;ve all seen some sus testimonials out there, but again, they work, because of course if someone unrelated to the company likes their product, the product must be good, right?</li>
<li>Influencer marketing (Nike was doing this with athletes before it was cool on Insta/YT/FB LOL)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Liking</dt><dd>we prefer to say yes or buy from people we like
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People are more likely to do things for you (incl. buying your shit, agreeing with you) if they like you
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MLM and network marketing works so well because it spreads among social networks (you&rsquo;re more likely to support your friend than Amway the company)</li>
<li>Customer referrals work for the same reason (i.e. &ldquo;invite your friends and get 1 month free sub!&rdquo;)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do you make people like you?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Similarity: we like people who are like ourselves
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ALWAYS start by creating rapport, talking about similar interests and hobbies with your prospect. Make some shit up if you have to (e.g. sports)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Familiarity: we trust people whom we have seen around more
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Joe Girard, a famous car salesman, got this to work by sending greeting cards every month to 13k of his former customers</li>
<li>Businesses always send those bot-generated personalised emails and newsletters</li>
<li>Or start a YT channel</li>
<li>cf. mere exposure effect</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Halo effect: one positive trait makes the rest look a hell of a lot better (e.g. physical attractiveness -&gt; more intelligent)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A lot of strange behaviour can be tied to peoples&rsquo; need to link themselves to positive events and separate themselves from bad events, even when they aren&rsquo;t directly responsible for them (esp. tribalism, nationalism)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. if you support NSW and they win State of Origin, you&rsquo;re gonna say &ldquo;WE WON&rdquo;, whereas if QLD won you&rsquo;d be like &ldquo;THEY WON (angery)&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fighting back
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be mindful of the difference between the request itself and the person making it</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Authority</dt><dd>we obey instructions from people who appear to be recognised experts, leaders or officials
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>cf. Milgram prison experiment and a few other questionable ones he did, some of which have been debunked</li>
<li>Hijacking the signals works too (the fake, the spectacle is just as good as the real thing - hyperreality)</li>
<li>Common signals of authority
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Clothes: a sharp suit or a uniform can make someone look smart. How many times have you seen an actor wearing a white coat (or a steth) in a stock photo or an ad, pretending to be a doctor?</li>
<li>Professional titles: usually having a title alone will make people more likely to obey what you have to say (e.g. Doctor, Dietitian, etc.)</li>
<li>Specialisation: same idea, just for specific fields of knowledge. Would you prefer to see a GP or a cardiologist for your angina, for instance?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Which is why for a business it&rsquo;s very useful to seem like <i>the authority</i> on your specific problem domain</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Defense against abuse of authority
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is this guy really an expert?</li>
<li>How truthful can we expect this expert to be (bias, etc.)?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sometimes the expert might make small concessions to appear more truthful e.g. seeming to argue against their own financial interests</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Scarcity</dt><dd>things that are scarce have more value/desirability
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>FOMO and loss aversion bias
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Applies to e.g. loss of freedom too (censorship, contraband, something is newly scarce when it wasn&rsquo;t before)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Techniques
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Limiting quantity of sales (cf. Off-White, Supreme, LV, Gucci, other famous streetwear brands)</li>
<li>Limited time only! (includes deadlines, expiry dates, etc.)</li>
<li>Auctions</li>
</ul></li>

<h4 id="org5f656de"><span class="section-number-4">4.3.4.</span> <a href="http://modernmachiavelli.com/48-laws-of-power-summary/">The 48 laws of power</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-3-4">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Never outshine the master :: Envy is a strong emotion that may turn not only your masters but also your closest friends or colleagues against you. Ensure that you don’t shine so bright that your boss and peers have to hide in the shadows, because they will sneak up on you and strike you where it hurts most, for the mere sake of protecting their ego.</li>
<li>Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies :: Remember the words of one of the brightest Modern Machiavellians, Benito Mussolini. The Duce’s credo was: &ldquo;It is good to trust people, but not doing so is much better.&rdquo; If you decide to turn an enemy into a friend, pay meticulous attention for an enemy turned friend might be an enemy still.</li>
<li>Conceal your intentions :: Put on a mask and wear it so long that the mask melds into your face and you become one. Under no circumstance must you let people peek behind your mask, be it friend or foe. Conceal your Intentions but subtely reveal fake Intentions for the sole purpose of pointing them into a dead-end.</li>
<li>Always say less than necessary :: The more one speaks, the higher the chance that the Prince violated Law #3 and unveils his intentions. Silence has a powerful effect when used in the right situation. Make silence your ally, not your foe and one thing you must not forget: You don’t learn anything new by talking. Use talk to lull your victim into false security and squeeze information out of him; otherwise say no more than you have to.</li>
<li>Guard your reputation with your life, for so much depends on it :: Your reputation acts as a messenger delivering a letter to whoever you are dealing with. Whether this is beneficial for you or not is up to you to decide. Determine the favoured reputation you want to accomplish and obsessively work on obtaining it. Pay attention to always be on the lookout and never to let emotion trump reason, for this may spell disaster for your reputation. Quell attacks against your good name decisively as soon as they emerge.</li>
<li>Court attention at all cost :: Men in general judge more by the sense of sight than by the sense of touch, because everyone can see but few can test by feeling. Everyone sees what you seem to be, few know what you really are; and those few do not dare take a stand against the general opinion. If you are not seen and are not the puppeteer, you will become invisible at best and treated like rubbish at worst. Avoid this at all cost and ensure to belong to “the gang” and to be seen.</li>
<li>Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit :: Why would you send your heavy troops into the heart of the battle while you still have mercenaries &amp; auxillery troops at your disposal, willing to do your work? Save your resources, send them forward and ultimately walk over their dead bodies to collect the spoils. Avoid being deceived by your colleagues in the same turn.</li>
<li>Make other people come to you - use bait if necessary :: To catch an animal you need to know where the animal sleeps, how it moves, if the beast owns superior skills and especially what it eats. After you have gathered the information, the Prince can lay the bait and patiently wait for his unsuspecting victim to run right into it. Even if the trap fails, your victim will be thrown off balance and desoriented, ripe for destruction.</li>
<li>Win through actions, never argument :: Any momentary triumph you think gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory:  The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion.  It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word.  Demonstrate, do not explicate.</li>
<li>Avoid the unhappy and unlucky (they are infectious) :: You can die from someone else’s misery – emotional states are as infectious as disease.  You may feel you are helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster.  The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you.  Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.</li>
<li>Learn to keep people dependent on you :: To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted.  The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have.  Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear.  Never teach them enough so that they can do without you.</li>
<li>Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim :: One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones.  Open-hearted gestures of honesty and generosity bring down the guard of even the most suspicious people.  Once your selective honesty opens a hole in their armor, you can deceive and manipulate them at will.  A timely gift – a Trojan horse – will serve the same purpose.</li>
<li>When asking for help, appeal to people&rsquo;s self-interest, never their mercy or gratitude :: If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your past assistance and good deeds.  He will find a way to ignore you.  Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion.  He will respond enthusiastically when he sees something to be gained for himself.</li>
<li>Pose as a friend, work as a spy :: Knowing about your rival is critical.  Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead.  Better still: Play the spy yourself.  In polite social encounters, learn to probe.  Ask indirect questions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions.  There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying.</li>
<li>Crush your enemy totally :: All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely.  (Sometimes they have learned this the hard way.)  If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually break out.  More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation:  The enemy will recover, and will seek revenge.  Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.</li>
<li>Use absence to increase respect and honour :: Too much circulation makes the price go down:  The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear.  If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired.  You must learn when to leave.  Create value through scarcity.</li>
<li>Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability :: Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people’s actions.  Your predictability gives them a sense of control.  Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable.  Behavior that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves.  Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.</li>
<li>Do not build fortresses to protect yourself - isolation is dangerous :: The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere – everyone has to protect themselves.  A fortress seems the safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from – it cuts you off from valuable information, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target.  Better to circulate among people find allies, mingle.  You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd.</li>
<li>Know who you&rsquo;re dealing with - do not offend the wrong person :: There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to your strategies in the same way.  Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives seeking revenge.  They are wolves in lambs’ clothing.  Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then – never offend or deceive the wrong person.</li>
<li>Do not commit to anyone :: It is the fool who always rushes to take sides.  Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself.  By maintaining your independence, you become the master of others – playing people against one another, making them pursue you.</li>
<li>Play a sucker to catch a sucker - seem dumber than your mark :: No one likes feeling stupider than the next persons.  The trick, is to make your victims feel smart – and not just smart, but smarter than you are.  Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may have ulterior motives.</li>
<li>Use the surrender tactic - transform weakness into power :: When you are weaker, never fight for honor’s sake; choose surrender instead.  Surrender gives you time to recover, time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait for his power to wane.  Do not give him the satisfaction of fighting and defeating you – surrender first.  By turning the other check you infuriate and unsettle him.  Make surrender a tool of power.</li>
<li>Concentrate your forces :: Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point.  You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to another – intensity defeats extensity every time.  When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time to come.</li>
<li>Play the perfect courtier :: The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity.  He has mastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the mot oblique and graceful manner.  Learn and apply the laws of courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can rise in the court.</li>
<li>Recreate yourself :: Do not accept the roles that society foists on you.  Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define if for you.  Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions – your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life.</li>
<li>Keep your hands clean :: You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: Your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds.  Maintain such a spotless appearance by using others as scapegoats and cat’s-paws to disguise your involvement.</li>
<li>Play on people&rsquo;s need to believe to create a cult-like following :: People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something.  Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow.  Keep your words vague but full of promise; emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking.  Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your behalf.  In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold power.</li>
<li>Enter action with boldness :: If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it.  Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution.  Timidity is dangerous:  Better to enter with boldness.  Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity.  Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.</li>
<li>Plan all the way to the end :: The ending is everything.  Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others.  By planning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop.  Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead.</li>
<li>Make your accomplishments seem effortless :: Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease.  All the toil and practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must be concealed.  When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more.  Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you work – it only raises questions.  Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.</li>
<li>Control the cards: others to play with the cards you deal :: The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice:  Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually your puppets.  Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose.  Force them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose.  Put them on the horns of a dilemma:  They are gored wherever they turn.</li>
<li>Play to people&rsquo;s fantasies :: The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant.  Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes for disenchantment.  Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert:  Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses.</li>
<li>Discover each man&rsquo;s thumbscrew :: Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall.  That weakness is usual y an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure.  Either way, once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn to your advantage.</li>
<li>Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one :: The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated; In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you.  For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others.  By acting regally and confident of your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.</li>
<li>Master the art of timing :: Never seem to be in a hurry – hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself, and over time.  Always seem patient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually.  Become a detective of the right moment; sniff out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power.  Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition.</li>
<li>Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best revenge :: By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility.  The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it.  It is sometimes best to leave things alone.  If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it.  The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.</li>
<li>Create compelling spectacles :: Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of power – everyone responds to them.  Stage spectacles for those around you, then full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence.  Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing.</li>
<li>Think as you like but behave like others :: If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them.  They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior.  It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.</li>
<li>Stir up waters to catch fish :: Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive.  You must always stay calm and objective.  But if you can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage.  Put your enemies off-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings.</li>
<li>Despise the free lunch :: What is offered for free is dangerous – it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation.  What has worth is worth paying for.  By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit.  It is also often wise to pay the full price – there is no cutting corners with excellence.  Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for generosity is a sign and a magnet for power.</li>
<li>Avoid stepping into a great man&rsquo;s shoes :: What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after.  If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them.  Do not get lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not of your own making:  Establish your own name and identity by changing course.  Slay the overbearing father, disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own way.</li>
<li>Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter :: Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual – the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoned of goodwill.  If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence.  Do not wait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them – they are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them.  Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter.</li>
<li>Work on the hearts and minds of others :: Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you.  You must seduce others into wanting to move in your direction.  A person you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn.  And the way to seduce others is to operate on their individual psychologies and weaknesses.  Soften up the resistant by working on their emotions, playing on what they hold dear and what they fear.  Ignore the hearts and minds of others and they will grow to hate you.</li>
<li>Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect :: The mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect tool for deception: When you mirror your enemies, doing exactly as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy.  The Mirror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them overreact.  By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson.  Few can resist the power of Mirror Effect.</li>
<li>Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once :: Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of habit.  Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt.  If you are new to a position of power, or an outsider trying to build a power base, make a show of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is necessary, make it feel like a gentle improvement on the past.</li>
<li>Never appear too perfect :: Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses.  Envy creates silent enemies.  It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable.  Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity.</li>
<li>Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop :: The moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril.  In the heat of victory, arrogance and overconfidence can push you past the goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat.  Do not allow success to go to your head.  There is no substitute for strategy and careful planning.  Set a goal, and when you reach it, stop.</li>
<li>Assume formlessness :: By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack.  Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move.  Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed.  The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order.  Everything changes.</li>

<h4 id="org627d074"><span class="section-number-4">4.3.5.</span> <a href="http://modernmachiavelli.com/psychological-manipulation-techniques/">A list of psychological manipulation tricks</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-3-5">
<p>
Not all of these are good, some of them show a clear inability to
adapt to different kinds of people, some are just clear-cut cuntiness
typical of a full-blown narc, and some are just stupidly bad
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Never show people that you are upset, for it makes you appear weak. Social Justice Warriors take note!</li>
<li>If someone makes a joke at your expenses, pretend that you didn’t hear it, while looking straight into his eyes. A joke that has to be explained or repeated loses its’ sting.</li>
<li>Utilise the Law of Reciprocity (By Robert Cialdini): People will feel obligated do a favour for you in return for your gift/kindness/favour.</li>
<li>Attractiveness affects how we are treated. Multiple studies have found that clean shaven, well-dressed men are treated more favourably by judges.</li>
<li>Learn to use fallacies, cognitive biases and dissonance to your favour.</li>
<li>If you want to gain access into a person’s life, especially of one of the opposite sex, use subtle flattery. Overt flattery will most likely be too obivous and have a reverse effect. (you do this by framing the compliment e.g. &ldquo;Not to embarrass you&rdquo;/&ldquo;I know you won&rsquo;t want me to say this&rdquo;</li>
<li>Whenever possible try to assume the role of the father (to women) or brother (to men). People will easily submit their trust to you.</li>
<li>The basis of authority? Body language, clothing style, financial resources, likeability/charm and intelligence. Combine them to lay the groundwork for all the other psychological manipulation techniques.</li>
<li>The Deference Principle: People will trust you and follow your instructions if you appear to be a person of authority.</li>
<li>Walk like a King to be treated like one. If you act like and appear to be in a position of power, you will soon find yourself in one.</li>
<li>Use the Door in the Face technique. Make an enormous request (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristobal_Colon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristobal_Colon</a> did when asking for funding of his expedition) without the intention of having anyone accept the unrealistic offer. If you follow up with a small request afterwards, you are much more likely to have your request granted. Avoid making too big of a request/demand though because you might run risk of sabotaging the whole negotiation with an insulting demand.</li>
<li>Similar to the Foot in the Door technique. Ask them for a small favour and if they agree, follow up with a larger request.</li>
<li>If you want people to agree to your request, offer to do a little part of it, they are much more likely to agree if they see your good will and that you are prepared to put in some effort.</li>
<li>The Placebo Information. Give people any reason using “because” in your request. Studies have shown that the compliance can skyrocket, when giving any reason for your request. For example: Can you join me at the event tonight because I need an escort.</li>
<li>Propaganda masterminds know that repetition is an excellent way to convince people of their point of view. The sweet spot for repeating something lies between 3-5 times, according to studies. After that diminishing returns set in.</li>
<li>Overwhelm people by speaking quickly and overload their brain with information or your views. This psychological manipulation techniques may both be used offensively as well as defensively.</li>
<li>People love people who like them.</li>
<li>Use positive affirmations. Tell yourself that you like your vis-à-vis or that you are not only the greatest, but the double greatest. Our subconscious minds affect the way we act and treat people.</li>
<li>People hate people who hate them.</li>
<li>In a conversation always be present, don’t let your mind wander but instead show keen interest in the other person. This will make the other person like you a lot more.</li>
<li>Whenever you want someone to cooperate, agree with you or want them to calm down when angry, stand in a 45° angle to them or next to them.</li>
<li>Standing or sitting in a direct line of a person tricks the brain into believing that the vis-à-vis is an enemy. Avoid this in interactions where your aim is cooperation.</li>
<li>People will be more likely to do you favors if you make more physical, platonic contact with them. Note the word “platonic”. Unless they are attracted to you, flirtatious behaviour will make them more aloof. One of the highly successful psychological manipulation techniques, frequently used subconsciously.</li>
<li>Be aware of whether a person is a “thinker” or a “feeler” and target your message accordingly. Most people though value emotion over rationality.</li>
<li>The three elements of every speech or debate? Logos (the Content/Argument), Ethos (credibility/authority) and Pathos (means to influence his audience or opponent, emotional appeal).</li>
<li>Caffeine increases the situation awareness and alertness. Usually a good thing, though it can be used for mental manipulation purposes. A person on caffeine is more easily influenced than he would otherwise be. A study found out that people are 35% more inclined to agree with you, if they are “high” on coffee.</li>
<li>Reversal: People who are tired, are easier to manipulate as well.</li>
<li>As a woman it is mandatory to never wear too much or too little makeup, unless you wish to come across as untrustworthy and unsympathetic.</li>
<li>Ask for a favour at a time most convenient for your target, making him less likely to refuse. No brainer, but I still want to empathise the need for proper timing.</li>
<li>If you want to manipulate people, alter their mental state. A scared, stressed, shocked or anxious person has less inclination to refuse. Reason is that they think with their primitive limbic system, which only knows black &amp; white, but no shades of grey.</li>
<li>Of course, the modern Machiavelli must not only use mental manipulation techniques but must also know how to recognise emotional manipulation, to not end up being the one deceived. A stoic mind helps and allows you to focus and think rational, making it easy to spot the characteristics of a manipulative personality.</li>
<li>Chew gum before or during a stressful situation to trick your mind into thinking that there can’t be an immediate danger, because you are “eating”.</li>
<li>It is possible to manipulate feelings and perceptions based on an object someone is touching. Heavy object = thinks more seriously about things. Rough object = pessimistic train of thought, bad mood.</li>
<li>Hard chairs make for a hard negotiation. People sitting on them are less likely to cooperate.</li>
<li>Women seem men wearing red as attractive and desirable. Men wearing blue as more stable, as boyfriend material. White = innocence.</li>
<li>A two-sided argument refuting the opposite argument is more persuasive than a one-sided argument. Read the definition here.</li>
<li>Light swearing at the beginning or end of a speech, debate, etc is often beneficial as it increases the audience’s perception of the speaker’s intensity.</li>
<li>What everyone is aiming for: Affiliation, being liked, accuracy and a positive self-concept and protection of his ego.</li>
<li>Tell people that they look/are exactly the type of person who would do xyz.</li>
<li>Convince them that you are Jesus Christ reborn. Pretend to be loved by everyone to create massive social proof.</li>
<li>Never use qualifying words (maybe, probably,…) when trying to influence people. Instead, frame your words in a way that makes them sound like you are only stating confirmed, definite facts.</li>
<li>How to manipulate people into thinking that you pose no threat? Look harmless and pretend to be an innocent sheep while actually being the big bad wolf in a sheep’s hide. Perception is reality.</li>
<li>Charles Manson tips on recruiting: Always keep the mood positive, tire them out, get attractive people to charm them. Interesting fact: his most favourite book, the foundation of his artful psychological manipulation techniques is the following book: How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People</li>
<li>Show interest in other people. If you do, people are more likely to like you. Ask them questions and focus on making the conversation about them, their experiences, dreams and interests.</li>
<li>People gravitate towards those with a strong, flawless reputation, even if their gut tells them that someone else, though more obscure, is a better leader. Keep this in mind while mentally manipulating groups.</li>
<li>Want to keep people down whose nutrition you can dictate? Keep their schedule busy and feed them a sugar-based diet. Useful for prison camp directors or people like Fritzl or Priklopil</li>
<li>When dealing with a religious person, swear to god that you are telling the truth, when lying.</li>
<li>A person who frequently draws attention to his genitals(scratching, adjusting down there. Holding his belt with his thumbs, ergo taking a manly stance) values his masculinity. Attacks on his masculinity will hurt him much more while he will love to hear compliments about it.</li>
<li>Mirror other people’s body language and actions. Don’t do it instantly, because they will catch up on it, but do it with some time delay. Attention: People trained in NLP will most likely catch your mirroring attempts.</li>
<li>Repeat a person’s name often during a conversation. Not only will this help you remember it, it makes him like you more. Don’t overuse it and pay attention to how they react. There are some people who hate if their name is used in a conversation, hence calibration is important.</li>
<li>Match your speech (speed, use of words, pitch) to your vis-à-vis to build rapport</li>
<li>Match your breathing, blinking and walking speed to their. In NLP referred to as “mirroring”.</li>
<li>Belief and emotion trumps rationality and logic.</li>
<li>Show, don’t tell. Manipulation is much easier if you base it upon tangible things and emotion instead of talk. Win through your actions, never through argument.</li>
<li>Avoid the bright spotlight. The darkness and shadows are your friend.</li>
<li>Give people the illusion of choice. Make them play with the cards you deal.</li>
<li>Women who tilt their heads back come across as less feminine, chin down = more attractive. Making the orgasm face (think of Marilyn Monroe) makes them more attractive, as well as signs of submission like high eyebrows or revealing the neck.</li>
<li>Obey your father. This was already written in the bible (I believe) and can be used to effectively deliver advice. Say “my father once told me, that it is best to do xyz that way”.</li>
<li>Men who tilt their head back are considered more masculine. Men who show signs of submission are less attractive.</li>
<li>Calibration is an essential tool of the skilful manipulator. Gauge reactions and emotions and adjust accordingly. If you see that you are overwhelming someone, slow down.</li>
<li>Different wording can make all the difference in manipulation attempts. Spin doctors excel at this and re-word a massive tax increase in a way that makes voters agree with it.</li>
<li>It is much easier to make an optimist passionate for something. Avoid the toxic &amp; pessimistic people, because they often are harder to fall victim to psychological manipulation techniques.</li>
<li>One of the strongest tools to shame someone is to accuse them of being creepy. This is a word nobody wants to be associated with.</li>
<li>Emphasise scarcity. People want what they can’t have, or at least what might be running short.</li>
<li>Reversal: Abundance. If you come from a place of abundance, are known for or appear to not be needing the deal/the girl/the job, you are in a favourable position.</li>
<li>Dominance is sexy. Women are more likely to agree with something, if they are touched on the arm during the request.</li>
<li>Squeeze people for the last penny. Be bold with your demands. Show no mercy because you will not be shown any. If you give someone a finger, they will take your whole arm.</li>
<li>Science confirms that strong emotions make people fall in love faster. Watch horror movies, rob a bank, go on a roller-coaster ride; create adrenaline.</li>
<li>Want someone to agree with you? Start asking them something you know they are going to agree upon, even if unrelated. For example ask a liberal person “I hate Hitler, do you like him?”. Follow up with the question or request you wish your vis-á-vis to agree upon.</li>
<li>Find out your common interests and strengths and exaggerate them, while downplaying or ignoring any differences that may exist between you.</li>
<li>Women who smile are more attractive. Men who smile less attractive but if they appear serious, men are more attractive. Attractive equals charisma and makes it easier for you to use psychological manipulation techniques on your target.</li>
<li>When you asked the buying question, shut your trap. Never make the mistake of talking yourself out of a deal.</li>
<li>If you were forced to make an apology, delivered it artfully and it was accepted, the same rule applies. Immediately stop apologising lest you want to talk yourself out of the apology.</li>
<li>Usually, when your apology has been accepted under protest and grumbling, it is best to not apologise again, for you might draw upon you resentments waiting to come at you. Giving it a little space and time is the preferred course of action here.</li>
<li>Never ever make the mistake to give your target reasons to not do what you want them to do. Sounds basic? It is not. Do not talk down your own qualities.</li>
<li>People like people who are like them. A narcissistic HR person is most likely to hire a narcissistic candidate.</li>
<li>It is human nature to trust their fellow man, hence are naturally born naive, susceptible to psychological manipulation techniques. The higher up you move on the food chain, the less naive and careless people are.</li>
<li>People who have recently eaten are easier to convince of something. Maslow’s Pyramid of needs at work.</li>
<li>Never immediately end a conversation after getting the information you need. Ask a couple of inconsequential questions or chat a little. Later, when the target tries to remember the conversation, they will most likely only recall the last 2 questions.</li>
<li>Human minds best remember the beginning and the end of, well, basically everything. A phone call, a job interview, a speech. Use this to your advantage (come first/last to a job interview, emphazise important points at the beginning/end,…)</li>
<li>Security is often an illusion. Never drop your guard, especially not at a business party, never reveal too much.</li>
<li>Never believe a conversation to be confidential.</li>
<li>Whatever you do, pretend like it is getting video taped, whatever you say, pretend like it is getting recorded. This is of utmost importance if you are a person standing in public focus.</li>
<li>A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still. While you may force someone to comply, remember that they will despise you for it.</li>
<li>Avoid the direct confrontation when arguing with someone who might be a potential ally.</li>
<li>When asking for a favour, it is only beneficial if you ask for it in front of the public/other people. If they agree, they look kind, and they fear that if they disagree they might look cold.</li>
<li>If you want your target to agree with you, nod while asking the question. If you want him to disagree, shake your head.</li>
<li>When asking for a favour, it is beneficial to appear dominant. Look them straight into their eyes. Intimidation is an excellent foundation for psychological manipulation techniques.</li>
<li>Dominate &amp; intimidate by looking at your vis-à-vis’ forehead or hairline. This is going to subconsciously evoke feelings of inferiority and insecurity in them.</li>
<li>Speaking of dominance, muscles do help, as well as a bald or clean-shaven head have been shown to have a positive effect on your ability to follow up with psychological manipulation techniques.</li>
<li>Being thin and therefore having a chiseled jaw makes you appear more dominant. A wide chin is a sign of high testosterone.</li>
<li>Don’t overdo it but take a sentence, rephrase it and feed it back to them. This gives them the illusion that you are an avid listener and interested in them. Also known as “reflective listening”.</li>
<li>Many people enjoy helping, hence, if you have a request, you can start by stating that you need their help.</li>
<li>If you see a bum and know that he is going to turn to aggressive begging techniques, ask him for money first to utterly confuse him.</li>
<li>If you feel like someone is telling only half the truth, utilise the tension of silence and stare at them.</li>
<li>Develop a stare that would make Mussolini proud. Staring someone down can be very beneficial during a confrontation.</li>
<li>Keep eye contact but don’t overdo it. People who lie often hold strong eye contact, despite popular opinion that they look away. This falls under the “silent” psychological manipulation techniques.</li>
<li>Don’t give signs of confirmation all the time while listening. Ergo don’t nod all the time or say “mhm/I agree”. This reveals your approval seeking agenda.</li>
<li>Flatter, but never flatter too much. Also, be careful when people are shy, because they will often resent compliments. Confident narcissists can’t get enough of them on the other hand.</li>
<li>Not only observe your target, but also the reactions of their friends. Sometimes the friends reveal your targets real thoughts.</li>
<li>Taunt your target into delivering excellent results, but questioning his abilities. Enraged people will go out of their way to prove you wrong. Use sparingly.</li>
<li>Touching guests, having a cheerful mood, giving them free sweets and drawing a smiley on the bill, increases the tips of waiters (and of prostitutes).</li>
<li>Ask questions to throw people off balance. For example, if someone is playing well (Poker, Sports, …), ask him what he changed about his game because he usually never plays that good.</li>
<li>Using a frame breaker in the form of doing something unexpected or asking annoying questions can be used in many other Situations as well.</li>
<li>Arrogant sales people sell more to rich buyers in outlet stores. This also applies to real estate. Adapt to your customer and you might even find psychological manipulation techniques obsolete in some scenarios.</li>
<li>The illusion of irrevocability says that people will change the way they think about something to justify their behaviour. If you gas enough people of a particular race/ideology because it is your job, you are guaranteed to despise those people.</li>
<li>Never underestimate the importance of a first impression. This combined with the halo effect can be either beneficial or catastrophic for you.</li>
<li>Divide &amp; Conquer. Alienate people to make them depend on you or to weaken the enemy from within.</li>
<li>People who think that you are a good-for-nothing-asshole are going to convince themselves that you indeed are, even if you start handing out soup to the homeless and rescue kittens in your free time. People hate being wrong and hence will try to convince themselves that their opinion of you was true.</li>
<li>Be bold, be confident, ask for more rather than less, exaggerate your skills and achievements, dress and groom well. The basics of every job interview or political speech.</li>
<li>Use reinforcement to manipulate people. Both positive and negative as well as intermittent or partial reinforcement.</li>
<li>Use sugar bread &amp; whip, rewards &amp; punishment. Use selective generosity to lower defences.</li>
<li>Enthusiasm is contagious. Always be in a cheerful, positive mood and others will start to love you for it. The opposite is also true.</li>
<li>A couple of confidence instilling tricks… the key to confidence is walking into a room, and assuming everyone there already likes and respects you. Make a habit of smiling at people… smile more and see how good you will feel about yourself, in the process you will make others feel good, and you will render yourself open to making more friends/associates. When alone, try making the biggest smile possible, you’ll automatically feel happier and more outgoing. Also, if you start acting like you’re a confident and assertive person, people will believe you are indeed that – ‘fake it until you make it’.</li>
<li>Read more about a favourable first impression as well as the art of forming a smile in my comprehensive summary of Law #12 – Use Selective Honesty and Generosity to Disarm your Victim.</li>
<li>Get comfortable hiding &amp; holding a knife behind a smile. The knife that is not expected cuts deep.</li>
<li>Act like you belong, like you are an authority, and many people will not question whether you belong somewhere or have bad intentions.</li>
<li>Writing things by hand improves the retention of the information, as students know, but also boost the likelihood of commitment to whatever has been written down.</li>
<li>People are lazy and will always try to take a shortcut. Abuse this.</li>
<li>In the same turn, think twice and hard about accepting a seemingly free lunch. Favours often are attempted psychological manipulation techniques in a sugarcoat disguise.</li>
<li>“’Cuz when niggers are scared, that’s when white folks are safe.” “The only time black folks are safe, is when white folks is disarmed. And this letter had the desired effect of disarming white folks.” Quotes from The Hateful Eight. Use fear to secure your power.</li>
<li>Avoid filler words whenever possible. Substitute the “ähms” for silence and recollect your thoughts.</li>
<li>Anecdotes persuade people better than data does. Anecdotes invoke empathy, which triggers emotional reactions that assist in processing the data and the feelings. Emotions also trigger the memory centers in the brain.</li>
<li>If I told you that 2 jumbo jets full of people died of smoking, and if I told someone else that x number of people die of smoking, who do you think would remember?</li>
<li>What does it take to become a Machiavellian strategist? Strong manipulation skills as well as excellent analytical cold-reading skills. Hone them.</li>
<li>If you are a bad liar and people can tell that you lie based on a specific tell-tale sign, incorporate this specific action in your everyday behaviour. Example, I sometimes swallow when I bluff during Poker, hence I swallow all the time (reading this sounds so wrong…)</li>
<li>People love progress and are highly motivated by it. Even small victories keep them happy and motivated to continue doing what they are doing. Example if your girlfriend tries to change you, give her something and pretend that you have changed. You can always revert back to your old ways later on. Change a small behaviour to justify a huge, terrible behaviour.</li>
<li>People lie most often on the telephone than they do during writing. Writing non-electronically decreases the amount and size of lies even more.</li>
<li>Body language and facial expression can change your mood. Stand like a king and you shall feel like a king. Smile and you will feel happier in an instant.</li>
<li>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. If you play the game of power, you will get better at it.</li>
<li>People often ignore or overlook discrepancies in favour of things that are congruent with what they believe to be true. Therefore a prince may appear as he wishes to be seen.</li>
<li>Always be nice &amp; polite, until it is time to stop being nice &amp; polite.</li>
<li>Depending on your opposite, it can be useful to appear meek, humble and non-threatening</li>
<li>Never hold a grudge against another person because it will cloud your judgement.</li>
<li>Never fight a battle if you gain nothing by winning.</li>
<li>Thank people often and congratulate them on the choices they made. This will reinforce their belief of having made a great decision.</li>
<li>Never believe anyone who constantly tells you what a great decision you have made. They are out to get you.</li>
<li>Ask people for their opinions and possibly follow the advice they gave you. Thank them later on for the great advice.</li>
<li>The beauty of mob mentality and social proof. Never forget that human beings are only a small step above sheep. Social proof and social pressure can be your ally.</li>
<li>Wear a cross necklace. Many people believe religious people to be good, righteous people.</li>
<li>(Pretend to) be nice to animals. Many people believe animal lovers to be good, righteous people.</li>
<li>Want an answer to a question? Instead of asking the question, post a wrong answer. People are much more likely to correct you than answer a question.</li>
<li>Everyone wants to be liked, admired and be right.</li>
<li>Not what you say matters, but how you say it. As well as who says it.</li>
<li>People will believe a person they like and defend their viewpoint, even if they are unsure of the truth content of said statement.</li>
<li>There is only one radio station people listen to. WII.FM. What’s in it for me?</li>
<li>I have a great memory but pretend that I don’t. If I was honest, I would rob myself of an excuse.</li>
<li>Plausible deniability is your friend. Use it yourself to avert repercussions. Use it on others to make them admit an error, submit information or not feel as bad.</li>
<li>Assumption Principle: Assume that the other person agrees with your terms. Example “I am going to come to your place and show you how I can save you money on your insurance. When is the best time?”</li>
<li>Also assume that everyone loves you, that every word from your mouth is golden and that your poop smells like flowers.</li>
<li>Even better is to combine this approach with limited options. Make people choose between 20:00 and 21:30.</li>
<li>More on options: never give people too many options. If you do, they will feel overwhelmed and do nothing.</li>
<li>Don’t fear rejection, be confident and never ever let anyone know that they have power over you, because you fear their rejection.</li>
<li>Gifts randomly given can have a huge positive impact. A gift constantly given in a row (3+ times) ceases to be a gift, but becomes an obligation instead.</li>
<li>The beginning and the end are remembered. The middle usually not. You can apply this law of human nature in various situations.</li>
<li>If you appear to be reluctant to ask for a favour or seem to be distressed, people are more likely to help you out.</li>
<li>If a person blinks fast they are usually bored with the conversation, but it is also a sign of distress. A relaxed person, or someone interested in you/the conversation will blink less.</li>
<li>With chewing gum it is the opposite. A person who enjoys something will chew faster. Offering gum to a woman you are trying to seduce can be a good move if you want to gauge her interest.</li>
<li>Be clear, concise and bold. Never say “do not hesitate to call me, if you like me” instead be bold and say “call me on Monday”</li>
<li>Never RAP with strangers. Don’t talk about Religion, Abortion, Politics and other controversial topics.</li>
<li>Be prepared for the unexpected. Make sure to have a Plan B.</li>
<li>If you are in dire need of a flood of motivation, burn down your ships and bridges and don’t have a backup plan.</li>
<li>Analyse yourself, assess your strengths and weaknesses. You need to know how you look and behave when you are in various situations, for example when not telling the truth. Realising something is the first step to recover.</li>
<li>Act dumb, uneducated, naïve or inexperienced. Others will become arrogant and prone to mistakes if they underestimate you and believe that every psychological manipulation technique used against you was going succeed without any resistance.</li>
<li>Be like a social chameleon and adapt to your environment. Think as you like but behave like others.</li>
<li>Always keep frame, never lower your mask even for the fraction of a second, because if you lose your mask, the mask is lost forever. Keep in mind that you must guard your reputation with your life.</li>
<li>Never fight a battle if you don’t gain anything substantial when winning. Play through all the possible scenarios in your head, or even better on paper, before making a decision.</li>
<li>Master the art of storytelling to charm victims with contagious stories.</li>
<li>Mastery comes through practice. Practice speeches, practice persuasion attempts, practice facial expressions in the mirror.</li>
<li>The general who wins the battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought. The general who loses makes but few calculations beforehand. Fortuna loves preparation and the modern Machiavelli must pay close attention to his plans</li>
<li>Always have a clear goal in mind and make sure to never shoot past the aim.</li>
<li>Analyse your target. Find out as much as possible about his strengths and weaknesses. You never know what kind of information can benefit you, or be used against him.</li>
<li>It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.</li>
<li>Having much information on your enemy gives you the upper hand. Adjust your dealings accordingly and lure them with the bait most suited for them.</li>
<li>According to the Needs Principle, a person who knows what another man needs can easily manipulate him.</li>
<li>Draw attention to something by mentioning it. I am certain that you know the “don’t think about an elephant” trick. Use this cognitive loophole to manipulate people into thinking about a certain thing. For example, tell someone about a house that burned down and then ask him if he has turned down the oven.</li>
<li>Make sure you only surround yourself with people beneficial to your goal. If you want to look like a sophisticated gentleman, don’t let it known that your friends are hooligans. Your company will always fade upon you.</li>
<li>If your target starts raising their voice, tell them that you’ll understand them better if they talk calmly. This phrase is provocative because everyone wants to be understood in a debate. Same goes for a sudden increase in speed.</li>
<li>Put the con in confidence. Never show weakness or seem hesitant. People despise weakness and will see right through your act if you fake it.</li>
<li>Learn from your own mistakes, learn from other’s mistakes, amplify their mistakes to gain leverage.</li>
<li>Don’t make the mistake of forgetting about the peripheral vision. Just because someone isn’t directly looking at you doesn’t mean that he doesn’t notice what’s going on. Women have a much better peripheral vision; this is the reason they are good at finding stuff in the fridge and their bags.</li>
<li>Make people jump through your hoops. It will make it easier to ultimately get them to buy. If they have to make a little effort, they are going to value you or your service much more.</li>
<li>people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.</li>
<li>The strong eat the weak. If you push someone, he won’t notice you stealing his wallet. If you accuse your opponent of a huge case of corruption, people forget that you are accused of being a Nazi.</li>
<li>Learn how to flash an authentic looking fake smile. Smile with your eyes, form the smile slowly. Don’t smile for no reason at all, or you will be perceived like Forrest Gump.</li>
<li>Use your body language as a tool in the psychological manipulation process. Stay tuned for a post on body language hacks and tricks to read non-verbal clues.</li>
<li>When going to McDonalds, you don’t have to take their shit in silence. If you buy a burger, demand to have it made fresh. If you order Coke, drink a chunk of it and then complain that there is not enough gas in the Coke and have them change the gas cartridge. Why? Because a man requires constant confrontation to not lose his bite. Life is a constant struggle and just like you need to lift heavy object to retain or increase muscle mass, you need confrontation to be able to regularly and successfully utilize psychological manipulation techniques in those situations that really count.</li>
<li>You can never fool 100% of the people 100% of the time, just like you can’t force compliance indefinitely.</li>
<li>Question everything, never believe anything without haven given it a quick, better yet thorough, think.</li>
<li>If you can’t be 100% certain that someone is telling you the truth, better assume that he is lying.</li>
<li>Never sweat the small stuff. Trusting someone’s word is good, but rereading the contract or checking the car for small damages is better. Remember what Il Duce said: It is good to trust people, but not doing so is much better.</li>
<li>Not only is it important to know your terrain, but you must also know your body. Be aware of it, know what is good for him and treat him in a royal fashion. Know how you react to various drugs and supplements and whenever needed, don’t be hesitant to aid your concentration or relaxation. Know the supplements that give you a mental edge over your opponents (read up on nootropics)</li>

<h4 id="org36f0231"><span class="section-number-4">4.3.6.</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w67YupDhPpY">Some psychology tricks I learned from a psych student on TikTok</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-3-6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Silence makes people unconsciously uncomfortable, so they tend to actively fill it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Useful e.g. when having an argument, someone is in a hole. Just stfu and look at them and watch them dig a deeper hole for themselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Observe who people look at when they laugh. People tend to look at whoever they like most.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If no one looks at you, sorry :(</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you point out a small (mutable) physical defect in someone they will immediately stop whatever they are doing and become very self-conscious about themselves
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. someone is yelling at you in retail, &ldquo;sorry there&rsquo;s something between your teeth&rdquo;, watch them stop</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If someone&rsquo;s making fun of you, just pretend you don&rsquo;t get the joke. The more they have to repeat it, the less funny/stinging it seems. Instead it just makes them look weak
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. someone&rsquo;s making fun of you. &ldquo;&#x2026;what?/what did you say, I didn&rsquo;t hear that?/I don&rsquo;t get it, what are you talking about?&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re at a party, hold your drink by your side instead of at your chest level, it&rsquo;ll make you appear open and confident</li>
<li>Can you remember something embarrassing that someone you know did 10/5/2/1 years ago? No? Then what makes you think that people will remember something embarassing you did?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bad example. I for one remember almost eidetically every single embarrassing thing that my classmates have done in high school, but I doubt I can say the same about other people.</li>
<li>Anyway, this is called the &ldquo;Spotlight Effect&rdquo;. Apparently most people <i>do not</i> remember the embarrassing shit you do unless it&rsquo;s REALLY BAD (MikeS stands out as being really bad in nearly every instance, which is why everyone gossips about him)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Where do you look when talking to someone? Lips = you&rsquo;re into them. Nose/eyes = neutral. Forehead = I AM BIGGER THAN YOU!!!</li>
<li>If you want someone to believe some fib you tell them, slip in some embarrassing detail about yourself. Just say it with confidence.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. &ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m late for work, I had to make an emergency bathroom stop/I had a bad bout of diarrhea&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you made a mistake or are taking a long time (e.g. in retail) DO NOT APOLOGISE OR SAY &ldquo;I&rsquo;M SORRY&rdquo; to the customer. Say &ldquo;thank you for your patience&rdquo;. Takes focus off the event, puts praise on them for even having to put up with you. Usually this leaves them in a better mood than if you had apologised.</li>
<li>In a hurry? STARE STRAIGHT AHEAD, WITHOUT MAKING EYE CONTACT WITH ANYONE, PEOPLE WILL THINK &ldquo;O SHIT THIS BOI GOTTA BE SOMEWHERE IMPORTANT&rdquo; AND CLEAR THE WAY</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re in the middle of a convo w/ sb, and hand them something, they are going to take it by default.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An extension: ask through hand gestures for something they are holding. They will probably give it to you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SMILE EVERYWHERE, PEOPLE LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE/APPEAR FRIENDLY.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. smile at the bartender, you will get your drink faster</li>
<li>e.g. smile at your co-worker, they&rsquo;re more likely to agree to
trade shifts</li>
<li>Subconsciously, smiling at anyone (even yourself in the mirror) will make them feel better/happier about you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>False attribution of arousal is very real. If you&rsquo;re taking sb on a date, go somewhere exciting, they will think they like you more.</li>
<li>Mirroring. Don&rsquo;t overdo it though, just be subtle e.g. doing the same hand gestures they&rsquo;re doing, repeating the ends of what they&rsquo;re saying (Nick does this a lot)</li>
<li>Want someone you just met to like you? USE THEIR NAME MORE. It&rsquo;ll help you remember it too!
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Again, don&rsquo;t go overboard. Use it in situations like &ldquo;Bye, Mark&rdquo; instead of just saying &ldquo;Bye&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Want to calm down? Chew gum! (activates the parasympathetic nervous system)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can do this before a date/interview/audition since you can&rsquo;t chew gum during</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Look at people&rsquo;s feet to tell how open or closed they are to you.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the group/the person&rsquo;s feet are directed towards you/open to you, they are having a good time.</li>
<li>If their feet are pointing away from/closed to you it means they really want to get the fuck out of there.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>STOP LETTING PEOPLE INTERRUPT YOU, IT MAKES YOU LOOK WEAK. Just keep talking in the same pace, volume and tone they were before. Just act as if nothing has fucking happened. They will feel awkward that you didn&rsquo;t even notice them, and stop.</li>
<li>Wanna get away with something? Don&rsquo;t make eye contact with the person you&rsquo;re trying to not get caught by.</li>
<li>When you first meet someone, try to notice their eye colour. The time it takes to do this = perfect way to show politeness + interest, but not enough time to be a creep.</li>
<li>Nodding while saying something will subconsciously trick someone into thinking that what you say is more authoritative.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good for job interviews</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&ldquo;Door in the face&rdquo;: ask for something absurdly demanding, which will make them more likely to accept whatever it is you wanted in the first place as a compromise.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. haggling. Seller says it&rsquo;s $6, I walk away and say &ldquo;ok no too expensive&rdquo;, he says &ldquo;wait how&rsquo;s $3&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it&rdquo;. Little did I know he was always planning to sell it for $3</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t overdo this though, e.g. &ldquo;I want this car for free&rdquo; &ldquo;ok gtfo&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Want someone who doesn&rsquo;t like you to like you? A good place to start is to just ask them for a really small favour
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. &ldquo;can I borrow your pen?&rdquo;. They might not want to do it, or might refuse but typically they will since it&rsquo;s such a small favour. And this will actually trick their minds into thinking &ldquo;maybe they&rsquo;re not so bad&rdquo; - Ben Franklin effect</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Primacy/recency effect - the beginning and end are far more memorable than the middle just by nature.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. be the first or last to do a job interview</li>
<li>e.g. if you&rsquo;re going on a date, do it at the start or end of the day</li>
<li>e.g. if you&rsquo;re reporting a history, summarise at the start and the end</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To beat procrastination, you need to work out how to do it in your head before doing it irl. So visualise/plan it step-by-step in your head, then pass some time (e.g. sleep on it) and then you&rsquo;ll find that you can JUST DO IT.</li>
<li>Ever negotiating? ALWAYS FLINCH on the first (sometimes second) offer.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. a wince, a slight physical withdrawal, a sigh, an eye-roll</li>
<li>GUARANTEED to get you a better deal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re talking to someone who won&rsquo;t shut up, drop something e.g. a pen, your keys. It will interrupt the flow of the conversation and allow you to get a word in.</li>
<li>COLOURS AFFECT YOUR MOOD A LOT e.g. red = angry, passionate; blue = calm. Pay attention to how colours influence your behaviour, especially in logos/interior design/etc.</li>
<li>If you listen to calm instrumental/classical music while studying, YOU WILL DO BETTER</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re too overcome by the desire for new shit, replace something cheaper (e.g. the case or the screen protector on your phone, instead of the phone itself). You get the same dopamine hit.</li>
<li>Look RtL instead of LtR if you&rsquo;re looking for something - you tend to miss things if you look in the same way you read.</li>
<li>The adjectives you use to describe other people with tend to get associated with your personality. So try complimenting people more often&#x2026;</li>
<li>Eat weird foods when studying and the same set of weird foods before a test. Weird smells/perfumes work too. USE THAT LIZARD BRAIN BOI</li>
<li>You can fake feeling well-rested by thinking that you are</li>
<li>Being around someone a lot will make them like you more (simple exposure)</li>
<li>If you like someone, just fucking tell them. Otherwise they just won&rsquo;t know.</li>
<li>Poor motivation? Just say &ldquo;y&rsquo;know what I&rsquo;m just gonna spend 2n on it&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll get the ball rolling</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t count up reps, count down (at the gym)</li>
<li>90% of your happiness comes from inside (mindset)</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-3-7">
<p>
By Kevin Mitnick, the famous hacker. The real value is in the stories of exploits he&rsquo;s actually performed. You can also find more examples by watching talks at DEFCON and other hacking conferences.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good social engineers are charmers</li>
<li>If you want to bring down a target, focus on hunting the big game targets (spear-phishing) rather than trying to hunt a lot of small game (script kiddie shit)</li>
<li>Unless you really have to, avoid showing your face. OPSEC/covering your tracks. It&rsquo;s much harder for them to pin down a voice than a face.</li>
<li>When it comes to information security, people are usually the weakest link (I can&rsquo;t count on one hand how many times I&rsquo;ve seen &ldquo;password123&rdquo; or &ldquo;Friday456&rdquo; as someone&rsquo;s password)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No matter how good your 2FA or password policy is, a compromised person (a &ldquo;spy&rdquo; to use Sun Tzu&rsquo;s words) will bring the whole thing down (hence, identity theft)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sun Tzu&rsquo;s Art of War: never reveal your true strength! Always let people think you are weaker than you really are.</li>
<li>You win by stealing information e.g. identity, taking someone&rsquo;s time, feigning interest in sth</li>
<li>Be careful who you get help from!
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sb in your org may cause an issue on purpose, resolve it for you and then ask for something in return (e.g. information)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Key &ldquo;tips&rdquo;. But above all of these should be the same things they always say at DEFCON which is, look and act like you&rsquo;re meant to be there and people will buy it
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Cushion the important question between inconsequential ones</li>
<li>Use a personal question to gauge their reaction</li>
<li>Use the lingo, sound like you&rsquo;re an insider</li>
<li>Door-in-the-face technique, because you really only wanted something MUCH smaller</li>
<li>Take advantage of the newbies who don&rsquo;t know shit and won&rsquo;t push back
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This may not work. If they&rsquo;re any good they&rsquo;ll call their manager for everything.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Especially with lower level employees, name-drop bosses or bosses&rsquo; bosses or the CEO to intimidate with the ruse of authority</li>
<li>Piggyback so most people won&rsquo;t challenge you. Carry coffee, or a bunch of boxes, and pretend you can&rsquo;t access your badge or open the door yourself if you need an excuse to get clearance.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Garnered variously from AskReddits, r/PsychologicalTricks, ULPT, ILPT,
LPT, etc.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Being imperfect actually makes you more likeable. Greene also wrote about this in 48 laws: &ldquo;never appear too perfect&rdquo;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You have to publicly show some flaw</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To counteract Bystander Effect, call someone specific out to help
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. you in the bomber jacket! get 911 here</li>
<li>e.g. who&rsquo;s got an epipen? what&rsquo;s your name? Tom? ok tom get me 911
and come tell me when they&rsquo;re on the way</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Complimenting people who are bullying you or insulting you (especially in a public place) will either make them stop or look foolish themselves. Just look at how Jeremy Lin replied to Kenyon Martin.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PsychologicalTricks/comments/ecmsrn/pt_how_to_avoid_regrets_large_and_small_by/">Don&rsquo;t touch any thought twice</a>, always deal with it rationally in the here and now - don&rsquo;t get caught in a cycle of regret</li>
<li><a href="http://imgur.com/zpqGh4w">FIRST IMPRESSIONS MATTER</a></li>
<li>If you hate gossiping and don&rsquo;t want to get enveloped in drama, and be well liked, shut down gossip by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aiv6l6/what_is_the_most_effective_psychological_trick/eer7wi8/">complimenting people behind their backs</a>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be careful, does not always work. You may end up being hated by everyone if you&rsquo;re surrounded by a bunch of Britneys (geddit because they&rsquo;re all Toxic???)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Want to encourage someone shy? Nod at them while they talk.</li>
<li>Want to make someone be more receptive to what you are saying, even if it&rsquo;s bullshit or they&rsquo;re obviously going to disagree with it? Start by handing them a compliment/agreement.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;Great question! I don&rsquo;t actually know the answer but based on what I know I can speculate that&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now we can all agree that the Soviet Union was unequivocally bad. And now is a good time to address every misconception about socialism that people have&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aiv6l6/what_is_the_most_effective_psychological_trick/eerbz0p/">Saying you won&rsquo;t keep someone as a way to halt a conversation</a></li>
<li>De-escalation:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mirror their level of emotional intensity but be toned down a little bit</li>
<li>Ask simple factual questions to get them back into a rational frame of mind e.g. phone no, name</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aiv6l6/what_is_the_most_effective_psychological_trick/eeqt5gh/">Need a name on your lead? Just ask with a filler</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. &ldquo;Is Dr Farnsworth still head of department here? / What? No, it&rsquo;s Dr Jansz&rdquo;</li>
<li>e.g. &ldquo;Is that your Focus outside? / No, mine&rsquo;s the Ferrari&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aiv6l6/what_is_the_most_effective_psychological_trick/eer97p2/">Strategic incompetence</a> - if you don&rsquo;t wanna do something, pretend you can&rsquo;t</li>
<li>By the same note, pretending you are stupid or naive may actually cause people to divest more info than they otherwise would have</li>
<li>If you are dealing with a narc, try to frame your idea as a competitor&rsquo;s or someone else&rsquo;s just so they will take it on</li>
<li>Misuse the paradox of choice: if people won&rsquo;t do something, restrict their options
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;ay bby wat u wan for dinner?&rdquo; &ldquo;idk u choose&rdquo; &ldquo;maccas or kfc&rdquo; &ldquo;kfc then&rdquo;</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use this in situations where correct information is vital e.g. patient histories</li>
<li>Landlords and salespeople often do this to try to pressure you into buying their products (including with time pressure)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t attack people. Just tell them how you feel, so they don&rsquo;t get a chance to become defensive.</li>
<li>Sandwich negatives between positives (Dale Carnegie also mentions this: sandwich a criticism between two compliments)</li>
<li>If someone is trying to rush you into deciding, they are probably giving you a bad deal. I&rsquo;ve got you now, landlords!
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is essentially just an application of gish galloping + false limitation of choice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>S&amp;D can also be applied to your behaviour. If you are often angry, people will come to expect it of you and it will not have any impact - that is, it becomes &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s in high supply.</li>
<li>Want someone to leave you alone, and they&rsquo;re not getting the hint? Print something or go get something, ask them to follow you there, then walk them back to their desk/office instead of going back to yours.</li>
<li>If a friend is telling/showing you something you&rsquo;ve already heard/seen/know, just let them. They might feel a little upset if you say &ldquo;I already saw that/you already told me&rdquo;.</li>
<li>When talking with someone, after they finish their story, ask them a question about it before going on to yours
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g. A talks about their fishing trip, B asks &ldquo;did you catch it or
let it go&rdquo;, A answers, B says &ldquo;that reminds me of a time when X&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DO YOU WANT TO BE THE REASON SOMEONE SMILES TODAY? Smile a bit wider when you see someone you know (who likes you), as they will feel that someone is happy they are around.</li>
<li>When giving someone a choice: start with the bad (and explain its negative effects) and then go into the good (and explain its positive effects).</li>
<li>Is someone watching you? YAWN. They will copy you.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-3-9">
<p>
This is basically an example of psychology tricks and cognitive bias
misuse in action. Ffs they turned it into a professional industry.
</p>

<h5 id="orgab644c7"><span class="section-number-5">4.3.9.1.</span> General information (Skeptics Australia)</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-4-3-9-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In all cases pay attention to their reaction and body language, and let people fill in details.</li>
<li>Confidence is key. If you do anything confidently enough people are going to buy it.</li>
<li>Start off with information that is statistically extremely common but not inherently obvious
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;a man in your family has cardiovascular disease&rdquo; (because men are more likely to have CVD, and CVD by itself is extremely common)</li>
<li>&ldquo;someone in your family is religious&rdquo; (most people)</li>
<li>&ldquo;you are between 30-50 years of age&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gain cooperation in advance - &ldquo;you need to help me; as language and communication is hard i may not always convey my intentions exactly&rdquo;</li>
<li>Barnum effect: seems personal, but applies broadly
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;i sense you are sometimes insecure, especially around people you don&rsquo;t know very well&rdquo;</li>
<li>Statements like these are called &ldquo;Barnum statements&rdquo;. You can use
them IRL by saying things like &ldquo;you seem like someone who likes
animals/travelling&rdquo; (who the fuck doesn&rsquo;t like those things?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rainbow ruse: statements that simultaneously confer a personality trait as well as its opposite; this allows you to cover all possibilities despite its vague/contradictory nature
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;most of the time you are positive and cheerful, but there has been a time in the past when you were very upset&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gimmicks like Tarot, crystal ball, palm reading add credibility. Alongside that make sure you have some words to use from things like palmistry/fortune telling/tarot</li>
<li>Keep your eyes open for other things that may reveal information e.g. personal accessories, jewellery, phone, scars</li>
